Backtracing
------------
A backtrace shows nested function calls by looking at records kept on the stack. These are called stack frames and are put on the stack every time a function is called. Each stack frame also contains the local variables for that context.

Memory Segmentation
--------------------
A program's memory is divided into five segments:
Text/Code - Assembled machine language instructions
Data - Stores initialised global and local variables
Bss (Block Start by Symbol) - Stores uninitalised counterpart variables
Heap - Stores memory which can be increased or decreased at any point
Stack - Stores temporary variables and parameters (LIFO)

Execution Loop - Instruction pointer
1. Read instruction pointed to by IP
2. Add byte length of instruction to IP
3. Execute instruction read
4. Repeat
